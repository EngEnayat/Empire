FOP-2025 Final Project

Project Overview

The FOP-2025 Final Project is an engaging strategic game where players step into the shoes of rulers in a fictional world. The objective is to manage resources, construct infrastructure, and expand territories while strategically competing against opponents. Through resource management and tactical gameplay, players aim to become the ultimate ruler of the fictional realm.

This project represents the culmination of our programming coursework, showcasing our understanding of game logic, algorithmic thinking, and collaborative development.

Features

1. Territory and Resource Management

Villages: Each territory contains villages that generate essential resources:

Gold: Extracted automatically each round and used for hiring soldiers and purchasing food.

Food: Supports population growth and is vital for expansion.

Workers and Soldiers: Workers assist in road construction and village management, while soldiers are essential for battles and conquering territories.

2. Road Construction

Roads connect villages and territories, enabling expansion and resource access.

Players must strategically construct roads to optimize connectivity and territory control.

3. Battles and Conquests

Players can engage in battles to conquer neighboring territories.

Victory is determined by the number of soldiers deployed and strategic decisions made during the game.

4. Game Phases

The game is divided into the following phases:

Phase 1: Map Creation

Players generate and customize the game world, defining territories, villages, and blocked areas.

Phase 2: Road Building

Players construct roads to connect villages and expand their reach.

Phase 3: Resource Collection

Players gather gold and food from their territories to strengthen their armies and infrastructure.

Phase 4: Battles

Players compete against opponents to conquer territories and expand their domain.

Phase 5: File Integration

Save and load game states for a seamless gaming experience.

5. Advanced Features

AI integration for challenging gameplay.
